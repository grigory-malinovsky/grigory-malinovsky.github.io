The focus of this course is on optimization modeling, which includes uncertainty in one form or another. This section includes both well-studied stochastic optimization, which has found an infinite number of applications, and relatively new and actively developing approaches: robust optimization and online optimization. Like the previous part of the course, in this one we try to keep a balance between theory, applications and algorithms.
