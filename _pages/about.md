Bio
======
I am an MS/PhD student in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. Peter Richtárik, working on optimization theory and its applications in Machine Learning.

My research interests lie in the intersection of optimization and machine learning. I am interested in stochastic optimization, randomized and distributed optimization methods and federated learning.

My hobbies include fitness, martial arts, football and basketball.
